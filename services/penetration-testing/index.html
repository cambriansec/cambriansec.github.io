<h1>Penetration Testing</h1>
<h4>Fri, Jun 9, 2017</h4>
<p>Cambrian Security will help you discover, prioritize and mitigate both security vulnerabilities and potential customer privacy issues.</p>

<p>During a penetration test, our team of experts will explore, evaluate and report on the security of your infrastructure.  The scope of assessments may be strictly limited to a specific application or it may be wide open, targeting your entire operational infrastructure.  Your incident response team may be tested or they may follow along and be part of the attack team.  The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, validate defensive measures and proactively improve overall security posture.</p>

<p>Security incidents are costly.  It is wise for businesses to regularly evaluate vulnerabilities or risks and their corresponding defensive counter measures.  For example, we recommend you do a pentest against any new technology or application you introduce or plan to introduce into your infrastructure.</p>

<p>Penetration tests also help avoid privacy incidents that can result in fines or legal issues and generally put your brand reputation at risk.  For example, we can discover particular exposures or application logic flaws that put customer data at risk and fix them before they are pushed to production.</p>

<p>All penetration tests result in detailed report that you can use to inform the immediate and long term improvement of your security measures.  You can share these reports with your customers, investors or partners and show them your organization&rsquo;s commitment to being proactive when it comes to your customers&rsquo; privacy and security.</p>
